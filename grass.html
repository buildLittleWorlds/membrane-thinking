  <p>A child said, "What is the grass?", fetching it to me with full hands;</p>
  <p>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.</p>

  <p>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.</p>

  <p>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,</p>
  <p>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,</p>
  <p>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?</p>

  <p>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.</p>

  <p>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,</p>
  <p>And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,</p>
  <p>Growing among black folks as among white,</p>
  <p>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.</p>

  <p>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p>

  <p>Tenderly will I use you curling grass,</p>
  <p>It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,</p>
  <p>It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,</p>
  <p>It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps,</p>
  <p>And here you are the mothers' laps.</p>

  <p>This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,</p>
  <p>Darker than the colorless beards of old men,</p>
  <p>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.</p>

  <p>O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,</p>
  <p>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.</p>

  <p>I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,</p>
  <p>And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.</p>

  <p>What do you think has become of the young and old men?</p>
  <p>And what do you think has become of the women and children?</p>

  <p>They are alive and well somewhere,</p>
  <p>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,</p>
  <p>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,</p>
  <p>And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.</p>

  <p>All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,</p>
  <p>And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.</p>
