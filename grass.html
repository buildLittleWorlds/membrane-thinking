    <h1>6</h1>
    <p>A child said <em>What is the grass?</em> fetching it to me with full hands;<br>
    How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.</p>
    
    <p>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.</p>
    
    <p>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>
    A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,<br>
    Bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say <em>Whose?</em></p>
    
    <p>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.</p>
    
    <p>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>
    And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br>
    Growing among black folks as among white,<br>
    Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.</p>
    
    <p>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p>
    
    <p>Tenderly will I use you curling grass,<br>
    It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,<br>
    It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,<br>
    It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps,<br>
    And here you are the mothers’ laps.</p>
